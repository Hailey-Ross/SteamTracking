In an FPS with a single function bound to the trigger, Hair Trigger will likely give the most responsive feel when rapidly pulling the trigger.  In a game where dual stage triggers are enabled via the threshold as well as the click, hip fire allows a quick pull of the trigger to hit the physical button without engaging the threshold action, while a slower pull will engage the threshold first.  Aggressive Hip Fire will engage the threshold action much faster than Relaxed.",
